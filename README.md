# Babel Librarian
### The last digital library you'll ever need

Babel librarian is a FOSS indexing tool and management system for books, manga, comics and more.

Babel can pull data about the item you add to your library from various sources (only from file metadata and libgen as of 0.1) and index it using user defined genre tags.

Goals and features for future releases:
  - access management system where friends will be able to share books between each other
  - more book information sources to fetch metadata from (google books, goodreads, amazon)
  - easily available statistics 
  - custom playlists for books
  - recommendation system based on read time, ratings and genre 
  - a more polished web client experience
  - docker container release

Babel librarian was part of a school project for my advanced programming class. I will continue working on it until release
